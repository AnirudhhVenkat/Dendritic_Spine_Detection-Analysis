Project Overview
Dendritic Spine Detection and Analysis
The detection_and_analysis.ipynb notebook leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (YOLOv9) to accurately detect dendritic spines in microscopy images. Post detection, the notebook employs a custom algorithm to:

Distance Measurement: Calculate the length from each detected spine to its corresponding dendrite segment.
Surface Area Calculation: Compute the surface area of each spine.
Dendrite Length Analysis: Measure the total length of dendrites in the sample.
Spine Density Analysis: Determine the density of spines per micrometer of dendrite.
These analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural characteristics of dendritic spines.

Datasets
Training Data:

The datasets used for training the YOLOv9 model are microscopy images labeled with dendritic spine locations.
Test Data:

Additional microscopy images used to evaluate the model’s performance in detecting and analyzing dendritic spines.

Usage
1. Running Dendritic Spine Detection and Analysis
Ensure the datasets are correctly placed in the datasets/ folder.
Open the detection_and_analysis.ipynb notebook.
Run the notebook to detect dendritic spines and perform subsequent analyses, including distance measurements, surface area calculations, and spine density assessments.
Model Training
The detection and analysis model employs YOLOv9 for accurate spine detection, followed by custom algorithms for detailed analysis. The following steps are involved:

Preprocessing images (resizing, normalization)
Model training using YOLOv9 with labeled spine data
Post-processing for distance measurement, surface area calculation, and density analysis
Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Results
Spine Detection Accuracy: 91-93%
Distance Measurement Accuracy: Highly accurate within the micrometer range.
Surface Area Calculation: Consistently precise across different spine shapes.
Dendrite Length Analysis: Comprehensive length measurements for accurate spine density calculation.
