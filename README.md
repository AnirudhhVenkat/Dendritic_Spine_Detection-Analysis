## Project Overview

### Dendritic Spine Detection and Analysis
The `detection_and_analysis.ipynb` notebook leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (YOLOv9) to accurately detect dendritic spines in microscopy images. Post detection, the notebook employs a custom algorithm to:

- **Distance Measurement:** Calculate the length from each detected spine to its corresponding dendrite segment.
- **Surface Area Calculation:** Compute the surface area of each spine.
- **Dendrite Length Analysis:** Measure the total length of dendrites in the sample.
- **Spine Density Analysis:** Determine the density of spines per micrometer of dendrite.

These analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural characteristics of dendritic spines.

## Datasets
- **Data Availability:** The dataset is available here: https://universe.roboflow.com/work-qfeh4/spines-kw7n6.
- **Training Data:** The datasets used for training the YOLOv9 model are microscopy images labeled with dendritic spine locations.
- **Test Data:** Additional microscopy images used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance in detecting and analyzing dendritic spines.
